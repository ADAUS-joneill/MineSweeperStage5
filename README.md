# MineSweeperStage5
Stage 5 of the CodeAcadmy MineSweeper project 


BUILD MINESWEEPER WITH JAVASCRIPT
Adding Class Structure
This is the fifth part of the JavaScript Minesweeper project. Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the fourth part. You:

Refactored generateBombBoard() using control flow
Wrote a function to retrieve number of bombs in adjacent tiles
Built user interactivity with flipTile()
In this part of the project, you'll group and organize much of this functionality together with class structure. Specifically, you'll:

Add a Game and Board class
Create an instance of a game and play a move
You should expect to write about 30 new lines of code in this part of the project, bringing the total to roughly 120 lines of code in minesweeper.js.

Let's get started!
